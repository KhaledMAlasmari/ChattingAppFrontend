# Chatting app frontend

This is a simple chatting app to send & receive messages. Built with the MERN stack.
The [frontend](https://github.com/KhaledMAlasmari/ChattingAppFrontend) and the backend [backend](https://github.com/KhaledMAlasmari/ChattingAppBackend) are on separate repos.

The project is incomplete. I don't really know if I'm gonna continue working on it but if I ever did I'll probably rewrite a bunch of stuff...


## Thoughts
I didn't really like working with React and frontend in general, but I learned a handful of stuff that I'm sure will come in handy in the future.
